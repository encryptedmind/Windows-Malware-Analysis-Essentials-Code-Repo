Description:

The book is mainly geared towards understanding the malware analysis thought process from ground up. It covers foundations of computer science like weighted number systems, bases and Boolean algebra in an exploratory manner to build upon a solid foundation. After that you get acquainted with the battery of tools commonly used for malware analysis. From there we move on to assembly programming and disassembly in VC++ IDE and work with the Visual Studio debugger features while investigating native binary compiled code constructs and data structures like structs and linked lists in disassembly and source code.

We forge ahead with a complete end to end preparation, analysis, signature creation and debriefing walk through of a real world destructive malware, where you get unprecedented insights on the workflow and thought process that can go into a typical analysis session. While most books describe the tools and techniques in isolation and let the reader connect the dots, this book demystifies any misconceptions involved in the process and aids the analyst in approaching malware reversing with full confidence. 

We then explore the most relevant and regularly implemented Windbg commands and certain tenets of Windows internals and finally wrap up with a detailed analysis walk through of web based malware and malicious obfuscated scripts, after which we take a roundabout tour of malware forensic tools and delve into incorporating malware intelligence gathering frameworks that can greatly aid your sessions from procurement to verification and various insights and revelations.
